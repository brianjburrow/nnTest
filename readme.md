# nnTest

UPDATE URL AFTER DEPLOYING

## About

nnTest is a simple application to test out Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Networks.

It provides a very simple, sinusoidal signal to train a neural network on.  It also provides
limited functionality to test tensorFlow JS models by varying the neural network structure.

## Current Progress and Future work

For now, only very basic, stacked LSTM models can be trained.  

- On the deployed side, we will limit the size of the neural networks a user is able to train.
- We would like to provide more hyperparameter tuning, model validation, and model selection.
- We would like to expand the data visualization, and create a dashboard type interface for the user to click through.


## Enabling Technologies

We would like to thank all of the open source projects that made this work possible.
